## Coding Assignment: Internet Checksums

In this sort coding assignment, the goal is to code a working implementation of the Internet checksum algorithm.

## Instructions

Open the file `checksum.py`. The function `calculate_checksum8` shows an implementation of the checksum 
algorithm for 8 bits (we will review this implementation in class). Your task is to provide an 
implementation for the 16 bit variant, which is the one widely used today.

Please take into account that no additional libraries are allowed!
